# Heart-Disease-Prediction with Machine Learning
Heart Disease Prediction with Logistic Regression and Random Forest. 

This project demonstrates a machine learning workflow to predict the likelihood of heart disease based on patient health data. It was developed as part of an internship task to practice data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, model training, and evaluation.
 
Project Overview:

The primary objective is to develop predictive models that identify patients at risk of heart disease. The steps include:

1. Data Preprocessing:

    Handling missing values

    Normalizing numerical features
  
    Encoding categorical variables

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

    Summary statistics

    Correlation heatmaps
  
3. Model Training:

    Logistic Regression

    Random Forest Classifier

4. Evaluation: 
    Accuracy comparison of models
